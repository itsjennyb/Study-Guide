# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was built to organize and display introductory study notes of the topics HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The construction and content of this webpage helps student developers, such as myself, to become familiar with the programming tools and languages prior to the start of coding bootcamp.

In building the Prework Study Guide webpage, I learned some basics of programming languages applied to a basic framework of a web app, and practiced application of good habits as a developer.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide webpage can be used to review introductory study notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, you can even see a bit of JavaScript code running: it lists the topics we've learned from prework and chooses a topic for you to study first!
