# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was built to organize and display introductory study notes of the topics HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The construction and content of this webpage helps student developers, such as myself, to become familiar with the programming tools and languages prior to the start of coding bootcamp.

In building the Prework Study Guide webpage, I learned some basics of programming languages applied to a basic framework of a web app, and practiced application of good habits as a developer.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide webpage can be used to review introductory study notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you open the DevTools console, you can even see a bit of JavaScript code running: it lists the topics we've learned from prework and chooses a topic for you to study first!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
